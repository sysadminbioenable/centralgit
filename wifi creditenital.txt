Sir progress till  now,

1. Created New IPv4 Policy as per Department-Wise
2. Created Traffic Shapers Policy Department-Wise
3. Also created Web Filtering Policy in 2 section for (Manager/TeamLead & Executives) 
Please refer below screenshot I have highlighted 

Sir please share if we can do any changes for further improvement

I have created single web filtering group & added my user under it for Testing purpose. But still website is accessing 
We have observe Web Filtering is expired in our Fortigade Firewall ( Which is used to restrict access of website )
Whenever trying to create web filter group we are getting this Popup-message 

It was working eariler untill it was going free trial of fortigate

Web Filtering is paid service of FortiGuard, Now they are asking for purchase subscrpition 




We have just created policy as per discussed, It will activate after final approval
